# How to Use

1. Obtain the folder corresponding to your Unreal Engine version from the root directory of the repository. The templates are contained within that folder.

    > You can download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git.

    **Warning**: Using templates with Unreal Engine versions other than those they were designed for may cause them to behave unpredictably. Use them this way at your own risk.

2. Copy or cut the templates you wish to add and navigate to your Unreal Engine installation directory. Place them in the `Templates` folder. If you installed Unreal Engine via the Epic Games Launcher, the default path on Windows should look like:
`C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_[VERSION]\Templates`

    > Templates follow two naming conventions: `[TEMPLATE_NAME]` or `[TEMPLATE_NAME]BP`. These represent C++ and Blueprint templates, respectively. You can install either one or both.

3. Launch Unreal Engine. The new templates should now appear in the project browser, allowing you to create new projects from them.

    > If you have both the C++ and Blueprint versions of a template, they will appear under the same entry in the panel. You can choose whether the project should be C++ or Blueprint-based, just like with the built-in templates.
